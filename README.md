## About the Project

Hello there!

This project is more than just the Final Project for my Front-End Development Bootcamp; it's also a personal initiative. As a beginner in the coding world, I've faced many challenges trying to understand programming concepts. Like many others, I often wondered if my struggles were partly because I had no exposure to coding until recently.

This got me thinking: wouldn't it be helpful to talk about coding in a simple, accessible way—especially for younger audiences?

As a woman learning to navigate the tech world, I wanted to create something focused on encouraging girls to explore programming. CODE GRRL aims to make coding easier to understand, fun, and approachable while inspiring others to embark on their own journeys in technology.
This is just the beginning, and that’s why it feels so personal to me. While this project might sound ambitious, it’s also my way of crafting my own story and documenting my learning journey.

## Technologies Used

For planning and organizing the project, I used **Canva** to create visual outline. It was also helpful in desining the projext presentation.

For the design, I used **Figma** to craft the layout and user interface of the application.

In terms of development, this project was built using:

- ![Vue.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/Vue.js-%2335495e?style=flat&logo=vue.js&logoColor=white)
 for buildind the interactive user interface.

- ![Tailwind CSS](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tailwind%20CSS-%2338B2AC?style=flat&logo=tailwind-css&logoColor=white)
 for styling. allowing for responsive, flexible designs.

- ![Pinia](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pinia-%2338A1F9?style=flat&logo=vue.js&logoColor=white)
 for state management, ensuring smooth data flow and app functionality. It also tracks the state and provide asn efficient way to share data fetched between components.

- ![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-%23F7DF1E?style=flat&logo=javascript&logoColor=black)
 for the logic and interactivity behind the scenes

- **Icon and Image Resources** for add visual
